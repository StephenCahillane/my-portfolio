    'Team Mentorship': `
        I built this Mentorship Team Project for developers who want to thrive in a team environment while growing
        their skills. This platform gives developers the opportunity to work on projects,
        where theyâ€™re guided and held accountable by a mentor. Mentors set tasks, track progress,
        and monitor study goals, while also offering one-on-one meetings and scheduling weekly classes and events. 
        The project uses a ranking system that rewards members as they complete tasks and make progress, leveling them up as
        they grow.

        The platform also includes a Mentor Dashboard, where mentors can log in to view the
        progress of all their team members, set tasks, and schedule events. Additionally, there is a real-time chat feature
        powered by Socket.io.
